# MacAnalog-Symbolix

Welcome to the **MacAnalog-Symbolix** project! This is an opensource symbolic toolbox for analyzing analog circuits based on SymPy in python. We're actively developing new features. A python-based toolbox means endless opportunities for future integeration with scientifict and machine learning (PyTorch) toolboxes.
