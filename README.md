# MacAnalog-Symbolix

Welcome to the **MacAnalog-Symbolix** project! This is an opensource symbolic toolbox for analyzing analog circuits based on SymPy in python. We're actively developing new features. A python-based toolbox means endless opportunities for future integeration with scientifict and machine learning (PyTorch) toolboxes.

## Features
- Customize nodal equation and impedance combination for new circuits under test
- Analyze the possible filters, oscillators, and more!
- Generate automatic LaTeX report of your runs

## Installation
After cloning the repository, open a terminal in the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

# How to get started
First Git clone the repo, and follow the instructions below you'll find information and links to the key notebooks.

- The main codeblocks are under [src](src/macanalog_symbolix/) 
- Quickly get started by running "run-cg" in the terminal to run the experiment defined in [common_gate_setup](src/macanalog_symbolix/common_gate_setup.py) and [main](src/macanalog_symbolix/main.py)
- Check out summary report of previous the latest runs in [Runs](Runs)
- Find Previous papers under [Papers](docs/Papers)
- A demonstration video will be available soon
