# MacAnalog-Symbolix

Welcome to the **MacAnalog-Symbolix** project! This is an opensource symbolic toolbox for analyzing analog circuits based on SymPy in python. We're actively developing new features. A python-based toolbox means endless opportunities for future integeration with scientifict and machine learning (PyTorch) toolboxes.

## Features
- Customize nodal equation and impedance combination for new circuits under test
- Analyze the possible filters, oscillators, and more!
- Generate automatic LaTeX report of your runs

# How to get started
First Git clone the repo, and follow the instructions below you'll find information and links to the key notebooks.

- The main codeblocks are under [Lib](Lib) 
- Quickly get started by [Run.ipynb](Lib/Run.ipynb)
- Check out summary report of previous the latest runs in [Runs](Runs) or in [Lib/Outputs](Lib/Outputs/)
- Find Previous papers under [Papers](Papers)
- A demonstration video will be available soon
