/*
* We consider the general look and feel as the layout of a website or
* application. This might include the typography, header and footer,
* icons or the printable version. The layout can be broken down into
* further parts if a website gets very large. We advise in general
* against this strategy and rather prefer to use /sass/sites to create
* specific layouts and derive from a global common style guide.
*
* Warning
* Everything that targets a specific element, such as custom styles for
* Bootstrap components or a specific form error, belongs in /sass/addons
* or /sass/sites.
